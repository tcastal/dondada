Beer is one of the oldest human-producest drinks. At the dawn of Beeriverse, about 6 thousand years before B.C. (Beerus Christ), humans in Mesopotamia produced a drink by fermenting bread. If any of us were to drink it today, we would probably find the taste awful. Later, in the Middle Ages, people in Germany began to cultivate hops,  the flowers of which were used to adjust the flavor and bitterness of beer. Then, over the past few centuries, what was once a simple drink with a simple taste evolved along with the people who made it. For example, porters were brewed for cargo carriers working in the cold Londonian environment, while Trappist monks in Belgium who used to produce everything they consumed developed a taste for strong ‚Äútripel‚Äù beers. These two examples are but a glimpse of the many styles of this godly beverage that were created and how they were influenced by many geographical and social factors.  

So embark on a journey to discover which style will win the battle to claim the title of most popular beer style of the Beeriverse.
